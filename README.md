## Including in your project
[![](https://jitpack.io/v/Shivamdhuria/puck.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#Shivamdhuria/puck/0.0.1)
### Gradle 
Add below codes to your **root** `build.gradle` file (not your module build.gradle file).
```Gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```
And add a dependency code to your **module**'s `build.gradle` file.
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.Shivamdhuria:palette:Version'
}
```

## How to use
```kotlin
Palette(
       defaultColor = Color.Magenta,
       buttonSize = 210.dp,
       swatches = Presets.material(),
       innerRadius = 400f,
       strokeWidth = 120f,
       spacerRotation = 5f,
       spacerOutward = 2f,
       verticalAlignment = Middle,
       horizontalAlignment = Start,
       onColorSelected = { onColorSelected(it) }
     )
```
### How to change positioning of Color Picker?

The color picker can be positioned by using the combinations of vertical and horizontal alignments. For ```verticalAlignment```, use ```Top,Middle,Bottom``` and for ```horizontalAlignment```, use ```Start,Center,End```. For example to position the color picker on top left, use -
```
Palette(
        buttonSize = 210.dp,
        swatches = Presets.material(),
        verticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Top,
        horizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Start,
         )

```
Which would make the color picker look like this.

### How to set button properties?
```kotlin
Palette(
        defaultColor = Color.Blue,
        buttonSize = 210.dp,
        selectedArchAnimationDuration = 1000,
        ...
        )
```
The library uses a FAB button under the hood whose `defaultColor` , `buttonSize` and `selectedArchAnimationDuration` can be set. `selectedArchAnimationDuration` is the duration of the color change animation of the button when a color is picked.

### How to change colors in the Palette?

```kotlin
Palette(
       swatches = Presets.material(),
        )
```
`swatches` parameter accepts a list of *Swatches*. Each *Swatch* contains a list of colors. Ideally swatches must only shades of the same color but sometime you need to go a little crazy. 


### How to know when a color is picked?

```kotlin
Palette(
      onColorSelected = { onColorSelected(it) },
      swatches = Presets.material(),
        )
```
`onColorSelected` parameter accepts a function which is triggered when a color is picked. It also return the value of the `Color` which is picked.
