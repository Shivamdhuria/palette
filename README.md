## Including in your project
[![](https://jitpack.io/v/Shivamdhuria/puck.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#Shivamdhuria/puck/0.0.1)
### Gradle 
Add below codes to your **root** `build.gradle` file (not your module build.gradle file).
```Gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```
And add a dependency code to your **module**'s `build.gradle` file.
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.Shivamdhuria:puck:Version'
}
```

## Usage
```kotlin
        setContent {
            // this keeps parents size
            val parentSize = remember { mutableStateOf(Size.Zero) } 
            PuckTheme {
                // A surface container using the 'background' color from the theme
                Surface(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(), color = MaterialTheme.colors.background) {
                    Box(modifier = Modifier
                        .onGloballyPositioned { coordinates ->
                            //Set parents Size
                            parentSize.value = coordinates.size.toSize()
                        }
                        .fillMaxSize()
                    ) {
                        //Adding puck to Card Composable
                        Card(
                            modifier = Modifier
                                .puck(parentSize, behaviour = FreeForm), backgroundColor = PINK200
                        ) {
                            Column(horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally) {
                                Image(
                                    painterResource(drawable.zoid),
                                    contentDescription = "",
                                    contentScale = ContentScale.Crop,
                                    modifier = Modifier
                                        .height(70.dp)
                                        .width(70.dp)
                                )
                                Text(text = "Card Composable", fontSize = 24.sp, modifier = Modifier.padding(10.dp))
                            }
                        }
                        //Adding puck to Button Composable
                        Button(onClick = { }, modifier = Modifier.puck(parentSize, behaviour = FreeForm, animationDuration = 700)) {
                            Text(text = "Button Composable", fontSize = 24.sp)
                        }
                        
                       //Adding puck to FAB Composable
                        FloatingActionButton(
                            onClick = {},
                            modifier = Modifier
                                .puck(parentSize, FreeForm, animationDuration = 700)
                                .width(90.dp)
                                .height(90.dp),
                        ) {
                            Image(
                                painterResource(drawable.pencil),
                                contentDescription = "",
                                modifier = Modifier
                                    .height(50.dp)
                                    .width(50.dp)
                            )
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
```
## Behaviours

Currently Puck supports three behaviours
- Freeform
- Sticky
- Gravity

### FreeForm
Freeform makes Composable draggable anywhere in the screen. If the user drags a composable out of screen area, it is coerced within the bounds of the screen.
<p align="start">
<img src="https://github.com/Shivamdhuria/puck/blob/main/assets/freeform.gif" width="18%"/>
</p>

For adding Freeform behaviour to any composable, do - 
```kotlin
FloatingActionButton(onClick = {},
                            modifier = Modifier
                                .puck(parentSize, behaviour = FreeForm)
                                .width(90.dp)
                                .height(90.dp)) {
                            //Image or anything
                        }
```

### Sticky
You can also make Composables stick to the edges or corners of the screen. Simple flick the Composable in the direction you want it to stick and it will follow the trajectory and stick there. To use stick you need to pass a parameter (EDGES, CORNERS,VERTICAL EDGsE HORIZONATL EDGES). Puck will automatically make the set parameter "sticky".
<p align="start">
<img src="https://github.com/Shivamdhuria/puck/blob/main/assets/stickNew.gif" width="18%"/>
</p>

```kotlin
FloatingActionButton(onClick = {},
                           modifier = Modifier
                                .puck(parentSize, behaviour = Sticky(Corners), animationDuration = 500)
                                .width(90.dp)
                                .height(90.dp),
                            backgroundColor = WHITE200
                        ) {
                            Image()
                        }
```
### Gravity
We can define gravity points with center and radius. Any composable that falls within this circle's gravity field will "zap" towards this center.
Note: The circle isn't actualy drawn as above while using puck. I have shown the circle only for demonstration purposes. 

<p align="start">
<img src="https://github.com/Shivamdhuria/puck/blob/main/assets/gravityN.gif" width="18%"/>
</p>

```kotlin
val circle = Circle(800f, 1800f, 500f)
FloatingActionButton(onClick = {},
                           modifier = Modifier
                                .puck(parentSize,behaviour = Gravity(circle), animationDuration = 500)
                                .width(90.dp)
                                .height(90.dp),
                            backgroundColor = WHITE200
                        ) {
                            Image()
                        }
```


## Attributes
- isPointsTowardsCenter - Currently this only works for Sticky(Edges) mode. Composable will always point towards center by using rotation animation. When a composable is dragged, the rotation value is set to default (0f), after the drag ends and the commposable sticks to any of the edges, the composable rotates according and points towards center. 
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/Shivamdhuria/puck/blob/main/assets/towards%20center.gif" width="18%"/>
</p>

- animationDuration - This is time taken in milli seconds for the drag animation. The lesser the time the quicker the animation. (Note: When the behaviour is set to Freeform, a composable is draggable without any animation.)

- focusedSizeMultiplier - When a composable is in pressed state, its size increases by this factor. You can set it to 1, if you don't want to increase it's size when in pressed date

- onOffsetChanged - This returns the latest int offset of the composable's position after the drag ends. You should ideally use it to save the latest offset in shared preferences/ datastore to use it again and position the composable when the app restarts again.
